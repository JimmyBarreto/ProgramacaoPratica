The technique requires no chromatographic separation, is able to distinguish 18 different compound classes (e.g., neutral nitrogen, carboxylic acids and oxygenates), and can identify ∼14,000 distinct masses by ultra-high mass resolution and mass accuracy. We previously studied three crude oils from different geological origins [Organic Geochemistry 33 (2002b) 743–759]. Here, we expand our research by comparing two source-equivalent Smackover oils of different levels of thermal maturity. We observe clear differences in the distribution of NSO compound classes, types (number of rings plus double bonds within a class), and number of alkyl carbons. With increasing thermal stress, the relative amount of sulfur and oxygen containing compounds decreases, condensation and aromatization of the polar cores increase, and the number of alkyl carbons decreases, reflecting the distribution of saturated hydrocarbons.},

  abstract = {We have examined, using a 12Tesla FTICR-MS instrument, the impact of varying thermal maturity level on a suite of 9 related crude oils charged from source rocks covering most of the liquid petroleum generating portion of the oil window (0.68–1.11% vitrinite reflectance equivalent (%Re)). The sample suite was analyzed as whole oils under three different conditions, electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive and negative ion mode to analyze basic and acidic components, respectively, and atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) in positive ion mode, for sulfur and hydrocarbon species. Increasing oil maturity level had a strong influence on the composition of all compound classes in the oils with several major observations evident: The relative apparent abundances of all heteroatom containing compound classes detected in this study, using all ionization modes, decrease systematically with increasing oil maturation levels. Both aromatic hydrocarbons, detectable in APPI mode, and NSO compound classes (detectable in both ESI and APPI modes), as broad classes, are becoming more aromatic (shift to a greater predominance of higher DBE group members) and dealkylated (decreasing average molecular mass of individual compound groups), with increasing maturation level in the oil suite. Several putative oil maturity level dependent, molecular ratios were identified in the study. Of particular note, the relative abundance ratios of heteroatom compound classes tentatively identified as alkylated carbazoles, quinolines and benzothiophenes, compared to their benzannulated homologues are very sensitive to maturation level. Several groups of compounds show interesting and specific carbon number distributions, suggesting there may be hints of specific molecular markers in the FTICR-MS data. One observation of note is the strong increase in the relative abundance of protonated hydrocarbon components with DBE 5. We speculate this might reflect the presence of previously unreported higher molecular weight diamondoid (diamantane) species in oils with up to 40 carbon atoms or more, at advanced maturity levels. Such species may prove very valuable as molecular markers in highly mature fluids, such as those currently being produced from some shale reservoirs. Covariation of quantitative GC–MS data for alkylated hetero aromatic sulfur and nitrogen compounds in this oil suite, together with the corresponding FTICR-MS data from compounds believed to be, based on accurate mass, alkylated sulfur and alkylated nitrogen compounds, suggests that FTICR-MS already has some very rudimentary quantitation capabilities.},

  abstract = { Crude oil samples are uniquely complex because of the number of compounds present that can only be resolved using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). The FT-ICR MS technique has been redefined for examining the composition of crude oil and its products, which has led to a new field called “petroleomics”. The chemical composition ultimately determines the chemical and physical properties and the behavior of petroleum and its products. “Petroleomics” predicts the properties and behavior of petroleum using its composition to solve production and processing problems. This paper correlates the chemical composition of crude oil with the total acid number (TAN), which enables the development of prediction models using partial least squares (PLS) and support vector machines (SVMs) as alternative multivariate calibration methods that allow for the application of FT-ICR MS analysis in direct measurements. The prediction models using PLS and SVM demonstrated low prediction errors and superior performance in relation to the univariate method. These results support the development of robust models to predict crude oil properties based on the vast quantity of information provided by FT-ICR MS using PLS and SVM as multivariate calibration procedures. },

  abstract = {A suite of six genetically related oils that had experienced varying degrees of subsurface, anaerobic biodegradation was analyzed by ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. By use of electrospray ionization of whole oil samples, all neutral nitrogen compounds and acid NSO compounds, from ∼300 to 900Da, are selectively characterized and assigned unambiguous molecular formulae. Several methods of data visualization reveal changes in the relative abundances of these compounds with increasing degradation. Evidence for selective biodegradation is observed in all compound classes. NSO compounds associated with long alkyl side chains are removed, regardless of the NSO core, under conditions associated with moderate (saturated biomarkers unaffected) to severe biodegradation. Some compound series, such as O1, O3, and SO3–9, are mineralized under conditions of mild biodegradation (n-alkanes, isoprenoids altered but still present). Changes in the Z-series (hydrogen deficiency) and alkyl distributions of the O2 species result from simultaneous microbial degradation and generation. Acyclic fatty acids decrease, whereas Z=−10 O2 species, which correspond to five-ring naphthenic (hopanoic) acids, increase in relative abundance during early stages of biodegradation. Monocyclic (Z=−2) O2 are enriched initially, and then decrease during advanced stages of biodegradation. O2 species corresponding to di-, tri-, and tetra-cyclic naphthenic acids (Z=−4, −6 and −8) are preferentially produced during these advanced stages. The ratio of acyclic to 2–4 ring cyclic O2-species provides a new parameter to define the degree of biodegradation.},

  abstract = {Seven reservoir core (tar sand) bitumens of identical source and similar maturity from the Liaohe Basin of northeast China possess a natural sequence of increasing severity of biodegradation. This set of samples provides us an opportunity to study the change in oil composition or compound class distributions with biodegradation severity by negative ion electrospray Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT ICR-MS). The bitumen extracts from two columns (Es3 and Es1) were separated into maltene and asphaltene fractions for analysis of heteroatomic species by ESI FT-ICR MS. The maltene fractions were found to mainly contain N1, N1O1, N1O2, N1O3, O1, O2, O3 and O4 classes, while the asphaltene fractions mainly contain N1, N2O1, N1O1, N1O2, N1O3, N1O4, O2, O3, O4 and O5 classes. These species identified by FT-ICR MS in asphaltene fractions are likely to be chemisorbed/coprecipitated compounds, or the species precipitated due to high polarity during deasphaltene process. The susceptibility of compound classes and homologous series to biodegradation was studied based on the relative abundances. The results indicate that microorganisms alter the distribution of acids and nitrogen-containing compounds by selective removal and preservation of certain classes of compounds according to their susceptibility to biodegradation. For example, O2 and N1O2 classes increase significantly while N1 and N1O1 classes decrease with biodegradation. The differences in the susceptibility to microbial alteration within acyclic acids, 4–5 ring acids and 1–2 ring acids are discussed and the differences in the susceptibility of homologous series of heteroatom-containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are also discussed in this work.},

  abstract = {Traditional hydrocarbon biomarker analyses determined the degree of biodegradation in two reservoir and two surface oils. These data were then correlated to the distribution and type (rings plus double bonds) of acidic NSO species selectively ionized and mass resolved by negative ion electrospray Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR MS) to determine if oxygenated polars could be used to estimate the degree of biodegradation in crude-oil contaminated soil (surface) samples. Since the histories of the surface samples were unknown (as it often the case for environmental samples), non-degraded and severely degraded reservoir oils were used as compositional benchmarks. The biodegraded reservoir crude oil exhibited an increase in relative abundance of O2-species, a decrease in acyclic fatty acids, an increase in multi-ring naphthenic acids and a decrease in C32 hopanoic acids compared to the non-biodegraded reservoir crude oil. The surface oils exhibited trends similar to the biodegraded reservoir oil, indicating that the surface oils were biodegraded in the reservoir, the environment or both. However, one surface sample also exhibited biomarker signatures indicative of a non-degraded oil. This evidence, in combination with the ESI FT-ICR MS data, suggests that the sample was contaminated with a mixture of biodegraded and non-degraded oils and demonstrates how analysis of hydrocarbon and polar fractions can reveal complex histories of surface contamination. This work is the first detailed compositional analysis of acidic NSO species in crude oil soil extracts and lays the foundation for our understanding of how surface biodegradation effects the composition of polars.},

  abstract = { Focusing on the O2 class, a set of crude oils from Llanos Orientales Basin, Colombia, were classified in terms of biodegradation levels using negative ion mode electrospray Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) and chemometric analysis. The O2 class, which is mainly composed of naphthenic carboxylic acids, was monitored because these polar crude oil constituents are known to be substantially affected by microbial activity. Principal component analysis (PCA) applied on the O2 profile was able to classify the crude oils into three groups: biodegraded, mixture, and non-biodegraded. From the relative abundances of the O2 class, a clear trend on acid distribution could be directly correlated with biodegradation: a rising in abundance of saturated acids with low double-bond equivalent (DBE) values (despite the lowering observed for fatty acids with DBE = 1), expressed by the A/C index. The combined use of two indexes, the A/C index and a new index also based on saturated acid abundances, the SA index, is proposed as an effective strategy to monitor biodegradation. This approach showed to be particularly useful to fill blanks on discrete biodegradation classification and when samples are actually composed of a mixture of oils with contrasting biodegradation levels. Results are in good agreement with predictions based on classical hydrocarbon biomarker analysis. },

  abstract    = {Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique that currently allows from the analysis of a single molecular ion to a profile of the distribution of ions in complex samples. This has been possible through direct analysis with different sources of ionization and also the development of ultra-high resolution mass analyzers such as the FT-ICR and Orbitrap. For complex samples such as oil, the most appropriate source of ionization is the electrospray (ESI) due to its stability and consequently reproducibility. Even though an alternative has been tested with the EASI-V ionization source, the responses obtained were not satisfactory. The analyzer FT-ICR mass is already being used for direct analysis of crude oil and allows monitoring and investigating of the crude oil and its derivatives. This new data about polar compounds may be useful to add new information starting from the oil crude exploration until refining. Additionally, it may also be useful in forensic analysis such as in crude oil spills and in the investigation of the compliance of different motor oils (mineral, semi-synthetic and synthetic) with their labels. In this study we have evaluated for the first time the MegaOrbitrap analyzer (still experimental) for crude oil analysis, which has proved to be as effective, if not better than, the widely used FT-ICR. Dealing with the analysis of a single ion in a forensic aspect, this technique allows the characterization of the dye composition used in the actual printing of genuine and counterfeit banknotes, and further, the dyes used to mark Real banknotes stolen from ATMs after they have exploded. Thus, this thesis shows results obtained from crude oil analysis performed by both mass analyzers mentioned, a fact unprecedented in the literature, and also forensic analysis results of oil, derivatives, Brazilian fake banknotes and also banknotes with theft indicators applied by explosives.},

This information has been translated into the major geochemical properties of the oil, but the level of reliability of the petroleomic approach by FT-ICR MS to compare samples or to predict sample characteristics remains an open question. To access this fundamental figure of merit, we have studied the repeatability and reproducibility of the ESI FT-ICR MS petroleomic method by using representative samples analyzed by different analysts and laboratories. In addition, the mean compatibility of the relative ion abundance obtained by two similar 7.2 T instruments located in different laboratories was evaluated. The data were analyzed via statistics tools, such as analysis of variance (ANOVA) to evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility among days and analysts, paired Student’s t-test to compare the means obtained from different laboratories among different typical samples, and control charts to monitor the analytical system. A high degree of precision in petroleomic studies by FT-ICR MS has been found, particularly for the most abundant classes of components and, hence, for the classes currently used for property evaluation. },

  abstract = {Variations of the acidic NSO (Nitrogen, Sulphur, and Oxygen) compound composition of the Lower Permian Irati black shales and Serra Alta shales were assessed by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) using electrospray ionization (ESI) in negative ion mode to test their significance for the regional paleoenvironmental reconstruction by comparison with known features in the northeastern and central-eastern Paraná Basin, Brazil. The high abundance of the S1Ox class for the basal Irati black shales in the northeastern basin reflects a sulfide-rich environment, whereas high O>2 classes in the Serra Alta shales indicate a high input of terrestrial organic matter deposited in oxic waters. Here, eight parameters based on O1 and O2 compounds are suggested as new paleoenvironmental proxies: phenol index (%DBE 4; O1 class); C27/C28 DBE 4 (O1 class); C27/C28 DBE 5 (O1 class); Even/OddFA; TARFA Odd (terrigenous/aquatic ratio); TARFA Even; C36 hopanoic acid index; and hopanoic/steranoic acids ratio. Higher values of the phenol index, the TARFA and Even/OddFA indicate higher land plant input during the final black shale deposition. Variations of C27/C28 DBE 4 and C27/C28 DBE 5, the first being based on the distribution of methylated isoprenoidyl phenols, can be used to reconstruct paleosalinity; here higher values indicate higher salinity. The C36 hopanoic acid index is higher for the marine hypersaline samples from the northeastern basin, while a significant bacterial biomass signal is stored as a higher hopanoic/steranoic acids ratio for samples from the central-eastern basin.},

  abstract = {Lacustrine and marine crude oils from different off-shore Brazilian basins were analyzed using a 7.2 Tesla LTQ FTICR-MS instrument. The samples were analyzed via electrospray ionization in the negative ion mode focusing on the polar compounds, i.e., nitrogen-, sulfur-, and oxygen-containing (NSO) compounds. We also employed a combination of other geochemical methods, such as GC-FID and GC-MS analyses, to characterize and assess the depositional environments of the different oil families. The results indicate that lacustrine oils tend to be enriched in Nx compounds, while marine oils show preference for Ox compounds. The dominant heteroatomic classes in crude oils are N1, followed by O1, O2, and N1O1 with remarkable differences in their distributions between marine and lacustrine, strongly suggesting the control by the kerogen type of the heteroatomic compounds found in these crude oils. Considerable differences in the DBE distribution of the main classes analyzed between the crude oils allowed an efficient geochemical characterization regarding their origin. The use of negative ESI FTICR-MS as a geochemistry tool can provide additional information beyond that obtained with currently employed geochemical methods, resulting in the full comprehension of crude oil composition.},

  abstract = {Three crude oils recovered from three different wells of the Mero Field in the pre-salt of the Santos Basin were selected for detailed geochemical analysis. The samples were analyzed using a 7.2 T LTQ FT-ICR MS instrument by negative electrospray ionization (–ESI), focusing on the polar compounds, i.e., nitrogen-, sulfur-, and oxygen-containing compounds (NSO). Additionally, a combination of traditional geochemical methods including GC-FID, GC-MS, and carbon isotopic composition (whole oil and n-alkanes) were used to assess the samples. Through this work, it was demonstrated that –ESI FT-ICR MS is a reliable method for assessing crude oil composition and providing information about the origin and thermal maturity of the samples. Results showed that the dominant heteroatom classes are N1, O2, N1O1, and O1. Due to the similarity of double bound equivalent (DBE), which means number of unsaturation present in an organic molecule, and carbon number distributions for the N1 class species it is possible to suggest that Mero's filling history had an oil charge representing the peak of the oil window (0.7–0.9 %Ro) and that the oils were generated by a source rock deposited in a lacustrine environment.},
